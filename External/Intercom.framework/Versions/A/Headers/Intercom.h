/**
 Intercom is your direct line of communication to every user, right inside your app. Intercomâ€™s in-app messages
 are up to 10 times more effective than email too! Send the right messages, to the right users, at exactly the right time.
 
 ## How do I track my users?
 
 In order to see your users in Intercom's user list, you must first register them via your iOS application. If you have a
 place in your application where you become aware of the user's identity such as a log in view controller, call one of the
 following depending on the information you have available for that user:

 If you have both a unique user identifier and an email for your users::
 
    [Intercom registerUserWithUserId:@"123456" email:@"joe@example.com"];
 
 If you only have a unique identifier for your users:
 
    [Intercom registerUserWithUserId:@"123456"];
 
 Finally, if you only have an email address for your users:
    
    [Intercom registerUserWithEmail:@"joe@example.com"];
 
 ## Can I track unidentifed users?
 
 Yes, absolutely. If you have an application that doesn't require users to log in, you can call:
 
    [Intercom registerUnidentifiedUser];
 
 If the user subsequently logs in or you learn additional information about them (e.g. get an email address), 
 calling any of the other user registration methods will update that user's identity in Intercom and contain 
 all user data tracked previously.
 
 ## I'm using a previous SDK version and this looks different, what has changed?
 
 We have re-architected the internals of the iOS SDK to ensure it is as reliable as possible while tracking
 your users. We have focused on removing the asychronous behaviour of the SDK for example you no longer need 
 to wait for the completion blocks of the old `beginSession` calls before logging events or updating user data. 
 In doing so the SDK is more nimble and reliable than ever before.
 
 Previous versions of the SDK will migrate with minimal effort. All deprecated methods still work for now, 
 excluding the old session listener (since v2.0.6). These methods will be permanently removed in a future
 version.
 
 ## How do push notifications work?
 
 The Intercom iOS SDK enables your users to receive push notifications for new messages. Simply call:
 
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
        [Intercom setDeviceToken:deviceToken];
    }
 
 in your `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` method once you have registered your app for 
 push notifications with the `UIApplicationDelegate`.
 
 When your app receives a push notification the SDK checks to see if it is an Intercom push notification
 and opens the SDK if required. You do not need to implement any additional code in order to launch the SDK.
 
 To do this we [safely swizzle](http://blog.newrelic.com/2014/04/16/right-way-to-swizzle/) the public methods
 in `UIApplicationDelegate` that handle receiving push notifications. We do not user any private APIs to do this.

 Initialize Intercom with your iOS API key and App ID.  This will allow your app to connect with Intercom.

 Secure Mode helps to make sure that conversations between you and your users are kept private, and that one
 user can't impersonate another. In Secure Mode the iOS SDK will sign all requests going to the Intercom servers
 with tokens. It requires your mobile application to have its own server which authenticates the app's users,
 and which can store a secret. More information on secure mode can be found [here](http://docs.intercom.io/Install-on-your-mobile-product/secure-mode-ios-sdk).

 user in Intercom, once set it cannot be changed.

 You can send any data you like to Intercom. Typically our customers see a lot of value in sending data that 
 relates to customer development, such as price plan, value of purchases, etc. Once these have been sent to
 Intercom you can then apply filters based on these attributes.
 
 A detailed list of the fields you can use to [update a user is available here](https://doc.intercom.io/api/#user-model)
 
 Attributes such as the user email or name can be updated by calling
 
     [Intercom updateUserWithAttributes:@{
         @"email" : @"admin@intercom.io",
         @"name" : @"Admin Name"
     }];
 
 Custom user attributes can be created and modified by passing a custom_attributes dictionary
 You do not have to create attributes in Intercom beforehand. If one hasn't been seen before, it will be
 created for you automatically.
 
     [Intercom updateUserWithAttributes:@{
         @"custom_attributes": @{
             @"paid_subscriber" : @YES,
             @"monthly_spend": @155.5,
             @"team_mates": @3
         }
     }];
 
 You can also set company data via this call by submitting an attribute dictionary like
 
     [Intercom updateUserWithAttributes:@{
         @"companies": @[ @{
             @"name" : @"My Company",
             @"id" : @"abcd1234"
         }
     ]}];
 
 id is a required field for adding or modifying a company. A detailed description of the
 [company model is available here](https://doc.intercom.io/api/#companies-and--users)
 
 @param attributes This is a dictionary containing key/value pairs for multiple attributes.
 @note Attributes may be either a `string`, `integer`, `double`, `unix timestamp` or `bool`.
 */
+ (void)updateUserWithAttributes:(NSDictionary *)attributes;

/*!
 Log an event with a given name.
 
 You can log events in Intercom based on user actions in your app. Events are different 
 to custom user attributes in that events are information on what Users did and when they 
 did it, whereas custom user attributes represent the User's current state as seen in their 
 profile. See details about Events [here](http://doc.intercom.io/api/#events).
 
 @param name The name of the event that it is going to be logged.

 Notifications thrown by the SDK when the SDK window is displayed and hidden. These notifications are fired
 only when there is a change in the state of the SDK's UI: when a user receives a message for instance,
 willShow and didShow notifications will be fired accordingly when the Intercom Notification (chat head)
 is presented.
 
 Once the user taps on the chat head, the message is presented in your app. It will be presented covering
 the entire screen, but no notifications will be thrown here as the SDK has already been visible.
